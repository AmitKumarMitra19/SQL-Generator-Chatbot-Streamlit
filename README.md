# 🚀 Built an AI-Powered SQL Generator — with Open-Source LLMs + Streamlit!

Ever wished you could just *describe* your analytics question in plain English and get the **exact SQL query** you need — instantly?

I turned that idea into reality.  
Using **Hugging Face open models (Qwen2.5-Instruct)**, **Streamlit**, and **DuckDB**, I built a chatbot that:

- 🧠 Understands your **database schema**
- 💬 Converts natural-language questions into **accurate SQL queries**
- ⚙️ Lets you **upload CSVs** and run SQL live inside the app!

## 💡 Tech Stack Highlights

- 🧠 **LLM:** Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct via Hugging Face Inference API  
- 💻 **Frontend:** Streamlit (clean, chat-style interface)  
- 🗄️ **Execution Engine:** DuckDB for instant in-browser SQL runs  
- ☁️ **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud + GitHub (open source, no secrets required)

## 🔍 What I Learned

This project was a great way to explore:
- How **open-source LLMs** can replace proprietary APIs for structured reasoning  
- The role of **prompt engineering** in generating correct SQL  
- Seamless integration between **LLMs and real data querying**

If you’re into **Data + AI + Engineering**, this is something you’ll want to try!
